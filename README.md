# Early-detection-of-3D-printing-issues

3D printing is an innovative way to fabricate parts from any 3D geometry model. However, 3D printing is also known to be prone errors. Most of these errors are visible via a close-up camera mounted right near the printer nozzle.

The goal is to predict 1 specific kind of error - under extrusion.
